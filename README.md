Webform Normalize
=================

This CSS is used to normalize the style of the CSS for a better styling.
The CSS is very simply and commented! You can:
<ul>
<li>Styling all field type: textfield, textarea, select, radio, checkbox, button.</li>
<li>Select, radio and checkbox is styling in anobtrusive way... only CSS!</li>
<li>If you use ValidateWebform jQuery plugin, is it possibile so send POST form via AJAX, and in the style there is a special class (inline-loading) that is the class element that substitute the submit button with the spinner loading image.</li>
<li>Working perfectly with Webform 7.3. The style is perfectly work also in Webform 7.4, expect for inline loading, that is non yet tested.</li>
</ul>
